gladiator is a pvp game

- define how is the exp system going to work
  - is exp related to level?
  - should it be related?
  
  - depending on the mosnters it should give e different exp, but the stronger the monster more chances the player has to die.
  
  - for the players lets give it a fixed amount of exp for now and just change it later for incentives to attack stronger players.

  for now the score is the counting the same for both monsters and players.

# how should the respawning work?
- [] should the player lose gold?

# goals

# pages

# TODO
[ ] for now lets not use health, it will only make the math more complex for now.
[ ] add a factor of lucky the the calculation? so it's never obvious who is going to win.
[ ] add DEFENSE, either to skills, armors or both

# ideas v1
[x] for now lets remove the respawn system since it just adds unnecessary components to the game.
[ ] adding a factor of lucky is imperative for battles because otherwise people can know who is going to win before the battle even starts. 
[ ] set all the attributes weights the same for now?
[ ] should the player lose gold?

[ ] if the player dies does he loses a consederable amount of exp?
- what is the relation between level and exp?

[x] create player profiles
[x] create a battle system
[x] create a leveling system
[x] create a ranking system
[ ] create a shop system
[ ] should have a banning system for cheaters? should be decentralized so no single person has the control of this
[ ] after each battle add story of the fight using gpt-3 given the parameters of each player/creature



# ideas v2
[ ] create a friends system
[ ] create a quest system
[ ] create a guild system
[ ] create a daily reward system
[ ] create a daily quest system
[ ] create a daily challenge system
[ ] create a daily leaderboard system
[ ] create a daily tournament system
[ ] create a daily event system
